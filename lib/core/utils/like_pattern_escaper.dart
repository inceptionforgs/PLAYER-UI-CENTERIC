/// This logic previously lived as a private _escapeLikePattern method
/// duplicated in both songs_service.dart and singers_service.dart, which

/// location moved, so both services can share one implementation and it
/// can finally be covered by tests.

/// Note: single quotes (') and double quotes (") are intentionally NOT
/// escaped here. Supabase's postgrest-dart client parameterizes the
/// filter value rather than string-interpolating raw SQL, so quotes are
/// not special within a LIKE pattern the way % and _ are.
