///
/// This is a deliberate fail-open choice: showing premium content to
/// everyone is safe (no security claim is being made), whereas a
/// client-only check that pretends to gate content would NOT be real
/// security and would be misleading. Do not wire `lockedWidget` into
/// real gating logic here without a genuine server-side entitlement
/// check (RLS / edge function) backing it — see File 19's related fix,
/// which removes the "VIP Member" badge in the drawer for the same reason.
